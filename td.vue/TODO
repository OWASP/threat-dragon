- Do a POC to use no back-end whatsoever (demo and test only)
- Fetch actions need to clear the associated state
- Gracefully handle an expired refresh token (TODO in httpClient)
- Logout
- Add tests for ThreatmodelEdit view
- Deep linking (redo routing entirely, match old way?)
- Update flow to create a new diagram
- Add report feature
- Add the download from github feature
- Pagination
- Error handling for API requests that might fail (toast service?)
- Add more e2e tests after the no backend work is done (hard to test since we would need loads of configuration)
- Document architecture
