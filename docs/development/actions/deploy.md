# Deploy

The deploy action is run on any "push" to the main branch (this includes merged pull requests), and serves as Threat Dragon's continuous delivery pipeline.  

## Build
This workflow builds and pushes the Docker image with the `latest` tag.  The `latest` tag is not consider stable, and may be broken at times.  While we do our best to maintain a fully functioning main branch, mistakes will happen.  Additionally, the full end to end test suite is only run once per day, so errors may not be immediately available.

## Deploy
The latest image is deployed to [https://www.threatdragon.com/](https://www.threatdragon.com/).

## Smokes
Smoke tests are run against the deployed image to ensure the deployment succeeded.

## Rollback
If the smokes fail, the deployment is rolled back.
