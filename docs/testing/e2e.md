## End to end testing

Running e2e tests is done using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
The full test suite is in `td.vue/tests/e2e/specs`
and this is where most of the functional e2e tests should live.

A smaller subset of tests, called "smoke tests", live in `td.vue/tests/e2e/smokes`.
Smoke tests are run against a deployment as a sanity check to ensure that the deployment succeeded
and there are no glaring issues in the deployment.
Smoke tests should be quick and only check the bare basics.

To run end-to-end tests locally `vue-cli-service` will have to available on the command line.
If there are errors such as `vue-cli-service: command not found`
then run command `npm install -g @vue/cli` from the root directory of the Threat Dragon source tree.

### Run test:e2e

To run the e2e tests locally, navigate to the `td.vue` directory and run:

```text
npm install
npm run test:e2e
```

This will open the cypress runner application and load the suite of tests from `tests/e2e/specs`.
From the cypress window you can select individual tests to run, or run all tests at once.
This suite of tests uses cypress configuration file `e2e.local.config.js`.

A quick test can be done using command `npm run test:vue`,
from either the root directory or the `td.vue` directory.
This runs the same suite of tests but in headless mode using an electron server back-end.

### Run test:e2e:local

This suite of tests is identical to `test:e2e`
but the target is an application already running at `http://localhost:8080/`.
To run these tests there first has to be a running web application, for example:

- from directory `td.vue` invoke `npm run dev`
- wait for the web app to be accessible on `http://localhost:8080/`

From a separate terminal in directory `td.vue` invoke: `npm run test:e2e:local`

A cypress runner application is opened as above, loading the suite of tests from `tests/e2e/specs`.
This suite of tests uses cypress configuration file `e2e.local.config.js`.

### Pipeline test:e2e-ci

This suite of tests is run in headless mode so that it can be used for the CI pipeline.
It uses cypress configuration file `e2e.ci.config.js` and runs the `tests/e2e/specs` suite of tests.

The tests are run against an existing application on `http://localhost:3000/`,
using port 3000 rather than 8080.

For local testing of this script, an instance of the docker file can be used to map port 3000:

- from top directory run `docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env owasp-threat-dragon:dev`
- from directory `td.vue` invoke `npm run test:e2e-ci`

These tests are run by the CI pipeline after a successful deploy.

### BrowserStack test:e2e-nightly

The online [BrowserStack][browserstack]  nightly tests use various browsers to run the tests
listed in configuration file `browserstack.nightly.json`.
The BrowserStack configuration uses cypress configuration file `e2e.nightly.config.js`
and the suite of tests from is loaded from `tests/e2e/specs`.

The e2e nightly tests rely on the demo server to be running at `https://www.threatdragon.com/`.

These tests are run by the `browserstack` github nightly action using command `npm run test:e2e-nightly`.
Test and debug these pipelines using github rather than from the local command line.

To check the configuration file `e2e.nightly.config.js` run this command from directory `td.vue` :

- `vue-cli-service test:e2e -C e2e.nightly.config.js --browser chromium --headless --url 'https://www.threatdragon.com/'`

### BrowserStack test:e2e-smokes

The e2e pipeline BrowserStack smoke tests rely on the demo server
running at `https://www.threatdragon.com/` and the scripts use command `npm run test:e2e-smokes`.
Test and debug these pipelines using github rather than from the local command line.

The BrowserStack configuration file is `browserstack.smokes.json`
which uses cypress configuration file `e2e.smokes.config.js`
and the suite of tests is loaded from `tests/e2e/specs/smokes`.

These tests are run by the `deploy` github action.
To check the configuration file `e2e.smokes.config.js` run this command from directory `td.vue` :

- `vue-cli-service test:e2e -C e2e.smokes.config.js --browser chromium --headless --url 'https://www.threatdragon.com/'`

### Run test:e2e-smokes:local

This suite of tests is similar to `test:e2e-smokes`
but does not use BrowserStack for various browser tests - just chrome.
The target is an existing application running at `http://localhost:8080/`
along with the documentation pages at `http://localhost:8080/docs/`.

To run these tests there first has to be a running web application, for example:

- from directory `td.vue` invoke `npm run dev`
- wait for the web app to be accessible on `http://localhost:8080/`

From a separate terminal in directory `td.vue` run command `npm run test:e2e-smokes:local` .

This will open the cypress runner application.
This suite of tests uses cypress configuration file `e2e.smokes.local.config.js`,
with the suite of tests loaded from `tests/e2e/specs/smokes`.

### Pipeline test:e2e-ci-smokes

This suite of tests is similar to `test:e2e-smokes`
but is run in headless mode so that it can be used for the CI pipeline.
It uses cypress configuration file `e2e.smokes.ci.config.js`
with the suite of tests loaded from `tests/e2e/specs/smokes`.

It is run against an existing application on `http://localhost:3000/`,
using port 3000 rather than 8080.

For local testing of this script, an instance of the docker file can be used to map ports 3000.
Decide on the docker image to test,
for example `owasp/threat-dragon:stable` or `threatdragon/owasp-threat-dragon:PR-943`.

- from top directory run `docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env owasp-threat-dragon:dev`
or if not using an environment variable file then run a docker container using:

```text
docker run -d --rm \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    -e ENCRYPTION_JWT_REFRESH_SIGNING_KEY='***' \
    -e ENCRYPTION_JWT_SIGNING_KEY='***' \
    -e ENCRYPTION_KEYS='***' \
    -e GITHUB_CLIENT_ID='***' \
    -e GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET='***' \
    -e NODE_ENV='development' \
    --platform linux/x86_64 \
    -e SERVER_API_PROTOCOL='http' \
    owasp-threat-dragon:dev
```

- check the web app is accessible on `http://localhost:3000/`
- from directory `td.vue` invoke `npm run test:e2e-ci-smokes`

These tests are used by the CI pipeline to determine if the deploy to Heroku was successful or not.

## Cypress use of Electron

Cypress uses the Electron server as a backend server, and has the Electron browser/renderer built in.
When running locally some tests do not (as of Cypress version 12.x) run correctly.
This means that it is good to choose a browser that is not Electron from the UI,
and that those scripts that run in headless mode specify a different browser (such as Firefox).

This is not a problem with the BrowserStack tests because a specific browser is configured for each test run.

## Writing e2e tests

If you are new to cypress, we strongly suggest reading through the
[Introduction to Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress).
The introduction document is a bit lengthy,
but does a good job of preparing you to begin writing tests using cypress.

Note that

- `td.vue/e2e.ci.config.js` and `td.vue/e2e.smokes.ci.config.js` are used by the CI pipeline on pull-request and merge
- `td.vue/e2e.smokes.config.js` is used by the CI pipeline on merge/deploy
- `td.vue/e2e.nightly.config.js` is for the scheduled daily tests
- `td.vue/e2e.local.config.js` and `td.vue/e2e.smokes.local.config.js` are useful in a local development environment

## Running Desktop e2e tests

The desktop application has end-to-end tests that can be run using `npm run test:e2e:desktop` from `td.vue` directory.
