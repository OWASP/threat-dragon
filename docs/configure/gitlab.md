## Configure GitLab access

[Threat Dragon](http://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon) can be run as a web application and
if GitLab repository access is required then some configuration is needed
for the necessary environment variables.
The GitLab specific environment variables are listed at the [end of this page](#gitlab-environment-variables),
other variables are described in
the [installation instructions]({{ '/docs-2/install-environment/#environment-variables-reference' | relative_url }}).

## GitLab repository access

Most of steps are the same as the [GitHub configuration]({{ '/docs-2/github-repo/' | relative_url }})
but there are some parts that are different:

1. Web App GitLab Access
2. Environment variables

### 1. Web App GitLab Access

It is recommended to follow the [gitlab official guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html)
to set up the OAuth Application.

The recommended configuration is similar to below:

- Redirect URI: `{BaseURL of your Threat Dragon Instance}/api/oauth/return`
- Scopes: Check `read_user read_repository write_repository profile read_api api`

Other options like `Trusted` are according to personal preference.

From the OAuth Application you will get `Application ID` and `Application Secret`,
which are used for the environment variables below.

### 2. Environment variables

The Application ID obtained from the Gitlab OAuth Application is used for `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID`,
and the Application Secret used for `GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET`.

The `GITLAB_REDIRECT_URI` environment variable follows
the pattern ``{BaseURL of your Threat Dragon Instance}/api/oauth/return``,
for example `<URL of Threat Dragon app>/api/oauth/return`

The `GITLAB_SCOPE` is set to the scope of permissions allowed for the Threat Dragon application,
for example `api` provides maximum scope and `read_user read_repository write_repository profile read_api`
provides a more restricted set of permissions.

The `GITLAB_HOST` is set to the base URL of the GitLab instance.
If you're using the official GitLab instance do not set this variable or set it to `https://gitlab.com/`.

An example set of environment variables to support GitLab access :

```text
GITLAB_CLIENT_ID=00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET=gloas-deadbeef0123456789abcdefdeadbeef
GITLAB_SCOPE=read_user read_repository write_repository profile read_api
GITLAB_REDIRECT_URI=http://threat-dragon-instance/api/oauth/return
GITLAB_HOST=http://gitlab-instance
```

Clearly these values shown here are _not to be used_ for a real application,
they are merely for illustrative purposes.

![GitLab button]({{ '/docs-2/assets/images/gitlab-button.png' | relative_url }}){: .image-right }

If Threat Dragon is successfully configured for GitLab access then the 'Login with GitLab' button is made visible.

Refer to the [the GitHub configuration]({{ '/docs-2/github-repo/' | relative_url }}) guide for
a similar example of setting up Github step by step.

### GitLab environment variables

| GitLab specifics | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GITLAB_CLIENT_ID` | The 'Application ID' provided by the Gitlab OAuth app used for authentication | |
| `GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET` | The 'Application Secret' generated by the Gitlab OAuth authentication app | |
| `GITLAB_SCOPE` | The scope provided to the Gitlab OAuth app | `read_user read_repository` |
| `GITLAB_HOST` | The URL of Gitlab server, for example `https://gitlab.com/` | |
| `GITLAB_REDIRECT_URI` | The redirect provided to the Gitlab OAuth app | |
| `GITLAB_REPO_ROOT_DIRECTORY` | Optional path where saved models are stored in a Gitlab repo | |
