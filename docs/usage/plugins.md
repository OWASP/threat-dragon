## Plugins
Plugins are a way to add optional and complementary functionality to the Threat Dragon desktop client. _Plugins are not required in order to threat model_. Plugins are contained in the main [Threat Dragon repository][td_repo]. This helps avoid the potential attack vector of a malicious plugin, as all plugin code is reviewed and maintained using the same standards and controls as the rest of Threat Dragon.

For more information on plugin architecture or how to develop plugins, please see the [Plugin development]({{ '/development/plugins.html' | relative_url }}) documentation.

## Available plugins

### AI tools
The AI tools plugin was developed by [InfosecOTB](https://github.com/InfosecOTB) to add LLM-based threat generation to Threat Dragon. This plugin exists only on the desktop client and is an optional feature.

For more information, please see the [AI tools plugin documentation]({{ '/usage/ai-tools.html' | relative_url }}).
